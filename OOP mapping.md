# OOP mapping

- Multiple inheritance: HFModelMixin and ModelAdapter combined in TextGenAdapter and ImageClassAdapter.
- Multiple decorators: log_call and catch_exceptions applied to run methods to show decorator stacking.
- Encapsulation: protected & private attributes demonstration inside ModelAdapter.
- Polymorphism: same interface (run) implemented by multiple adapters.
- Method overriding: subclasses override abstract methods from ModelAdapter.
